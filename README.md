## About

This is the official implementation of the algorithm **ReBAR** proposed in the paper "[Collision Avoidance Verification of Multi-agent Systems with Learned Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03314)".
The algorithm computes relative backprojection sets to verify the collision avoidance safety of the given multiagent system.
